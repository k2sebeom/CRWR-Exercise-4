                "I first started playing piano when I was 10. I had never thought I would do a piano major. I liked listening to music though. I enjoyed listening to classical music, but I also liked listening to hard rock and pop music. You know, I was a teenager back then. When I was in the second year at highschool, I suddenly decided to major in music. I chose pianoas my major and started preparing for admissions to conservatories. It was a late decision, of course. Many of the Korean students choose their instrument when they are very young. Even a 6 years old kid play flute or clarinet. People told me it was too late to choose a career path in music, but I wanted to do it anyway."

                "Admissions process was extremely painful. There are hundreds of students who started preparing for this several years earlier than me. I have applied to the same school for 5 times and was rejected 5 times. There was this one incident that I was really frustrated. During the audition, juries have a bell in front of them. When they ring a bell, it usually means that they've heard enough, so you have to stop playing immediately and leave the room. While I was playing the first movement of my piece, one of the juries rang a bell, so I stopped playing and left the room. When I was about the leave the door, one of the staff members ran to me and said that I should not have left, and the bell means to play the next movement. I went back to the room, but I was in panic, so I could not finish the rest of the audition. Later, I found out that it was a very abnormal case, so my high school teacher called the admissions office and ranted about an hour. I managed to make it to the 2nd place of the waitlist, but I was rejected eventually."

                "Going through the admissions process 5 times is painful. Some people may think that I have wasted 5 years of life, but I don't agree with them. I have started my career in music later than others, and those 5 years provided me an important time to transition from my ordinary life to a life in which I follow my dream and passion, music. Also, I have endured 5 years of continual rejection to finally find my chance to Oberlin. In retrospect, I think I was lucky. Oberlin is a great place for self-improvement, and I like the environment and people. Now I am in my third year, so I have completed more than half of my time in Oberlin. Pursuing a career in music means that you sometimes have to overcome a termendous amount of pressure and stress. However, I am thankful that I can continue my career in music, and I am thankful for this chance given to me."
